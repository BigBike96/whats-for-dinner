# What's for dinner - Solo Project

## Project Description
Have you ever asked yourself, "What should I have for dinner tonight?". Well, wonder no more! The 'What's for Dinner' project is an application that can produce a random food suggestion with the click of a button. Upon entering the page the user can select the type of dish for which they would like a suggestion. After clicking the radio button for the appropriate selection, the user can click the button labeled "LET'S COOK!" and a random food suggestion will appear on the white box to the right of the screen.
